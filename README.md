# Introduction to CSS Grid

CSS Grid Layout is a brand new module available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows.

To work with CSS Grid Layout, we apply CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that element's children (which become Grid Items).

## Getting Started

To use CSS Grid, we need to define the container element as a grid with:

```
display: grid;
```
